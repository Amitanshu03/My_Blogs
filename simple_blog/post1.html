                Think about how often you interact with AI daily:
                
                Voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant
                
                Recommendation systems on Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon
                
                Smart home devices, facial recognition, and GPS navigation
                
                
                These tools use AI to provide personalized, real-time experiences that make life easier and more convenient.
